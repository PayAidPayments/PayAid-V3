## ⚠️ CRITICAL GAPS & MISSING FEATURES

### **1. REVENUE/MONETIZATION INTEGRATION (78/100)** ⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION
**This is your biggest gap relative to market leaders.**

#### What's Missing:
- ❌ **Quote Management (CPQ)** - No quote creation/approval workflow
- ❌ **Contract Management** - No contract lifecycle, e-signature integration (DocuSign)
- ❌ **Subscription Management** - No recurring billing, upsell/renewal tracking
- ❌ **Revenue Recognition** - No ASC 606 compliance for accounting
- ❌ **Invoice Integration** - Limited to order-to-invoice, no standalone invoice management
- ❌ **Payment Tracking** - Linked to PayAid but not tight enough
- ❌ **Proposal Management** - No proposal creation from deals

#### Business Impact:
**This gap costs you:**
- ❌ Can't track full customer lifetime value (only orders, missing recurring)
- ❌ Can't manage quotes (sales teams use Word/Google Docs instead)
- ❌ Can't automate invoice-to-collection (manual follow-ups)
- ❌ Can't predict renewal revenue (churn prediction is generic)

#### Recommendation - PHASE 7 (Weeks 13-14):
```
Week 13: Quote & Contract Management
├─ Create Quote model (Deal → Quote → Order)
├─ Implement proposal builder (from deal details)
├─ Integrate DocuSign for e-signature
├─ Add quote acceptance tracking
└─ Create quote-to-deal conversion metrics

Week 14: Subscription & Revenue Management
├─ Add subscription tracking to contracts
├─ Create renewal/upsell pipeline
├─ Integrate with PayAid billing API
├─ Add revenue recognition rules (ASC 606)
└─ Create revenue dashboard (MRR, ARR, churn rate)
```

**Effort:** 2 weeks, 1 backend + 1 frontend engineer  
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL for India market (subscription model is B2B default)

---

### **2. TERRITORY & ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT (60/100)** ⚠️ MAJOR GAP
**Enterprise feature, but important for scaling sales teams.**

#### What's Missing:
- ❌ **Territory Assignment** - No auto-assignment by geography/industry
- ❌ **Account Hierarchy** - Parent account → sub-accounts not fully modeled
- ❌ **Multi-person Accounts** - No decision-maker tracking or stakeholder management
- ❌ **Account Team Management** - No role-based team assignment (who owns what?)
- ❌ **Account Health Dashboard** - Missing in favor of contact health
- ❌ **Account Planning** - No annual account plans or strategic initiatives tracking

#### Business Impact:
- **For Fintech:** Can't manage bank vs. wallet customers differently
- **For D2C:** Can't differentiate between supplier (parent) and brand (customer)
- **For Agencies:** Can't track which teams service which accounts

#### Recommendation - PHASE 7:
```
Add Account Management (1 week):
├─ Enhance Account model with hierarchy
├─ Create territory assignment rules
├─ Add account team management
├─ Create account-based dashboards
└─ Territory analytics
```

**Priority:** 🟠 HIGH for enterprise sales (defer to Phase 2)

---

### **3. FIELD SERVICE & RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (0/100)** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Important for service-based verticals (agencies, consultants, contractors).**

#### What's Missing:

- ❌ Service appointment management
- ❌ Work order creation and tracking

- Equipment service providers

#### Recommendation:
**Skip for MVP launch. Add as Phase 8 (Week 15-16) if targeting field service verticals.**

---

### **4. KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT & CONTENT LIBRARY (40/100)** ⚠️ PARTIAL GAP
**Important for sales enablement.**

#### What's Missing:
- ❌ Sales playbooks (deal stages → recommended actions)
- ❌ Proposal template library (with versioning)
- ❌ Email templates (basic exists, but no segmentation)
- ❌ Case studies/social proof library (linked to use cases)
- ❌ Competitive intelligence database
- ❌ Industry benchmarks and pricing data
- ❌ Product knowledge base (what to pitch to whom)

#### Implemented:
- ✅ Basic email templates
- ✅ Industry templates (partial knowledge capture)
- ✅ Playbooks framework (via automation engine)

#### Recommendation - PHASE 7:
```
Add Knowledge Management (1 week):
├─ Create sales playbook module
├─ Build proposal template library
├─ Add email template segmentation
├─ Implement case study linking
└─ Create competitive intelligence tracker
```

**Priority:** 🟠 HIGH for sales adoption (can improve win rates by 15-20%)

---

├─ Implement historical trending
└─ Add attribution modeling
```

**Priority:** 🟠 HIGH (critical for data-driven orgs)

---

### **6. GENERATIVE AI AGENTS (0/100)** ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
**This is where market is headed in 2025.**

#### What Competitors Are Doing:
- **Salesforce Agentforce (3rd Gen):** Autonomous agents that execute sales tasks
- **Microsoft Copilot Studio:** AI agents integrated into CRM workflows
- **Zendesk AI Agents:** Customer service agents that resolve issues autonomously

#### What You Should Consider:
- ⚠️ **AI Email Generation:** Auto-compose followup emails
- ⚠️ **AI Task Generation:** AI suggests next actions based on conversation
- ⚠️ **AI Lead Research:** Auto-research and enrich lead data
- ⚠️ **AI Meeting Summary:** Auto-summarize meetings (you have transcription, not summary)

#### Recommendation:
**Phase 8 (Weeks 17-18)** - This is cutting edge, lower priority for launch:
```
Generative AI Agents (2 weeks):
├─ Implement email composition agent
├─ Add task suggestion agent
├─ Create lead enrichment agent
└─ Integrate meeting summary generation
```

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM for Phase 2 (after MVP launch)

---

- ❌ **Zapier/Make.com** - No native webhook support for no-code automation
- ❌ **E-signature** (DocuSign) - Referenced but not integrated

- ❌ **Help Desk Integration** - No Zendesk/Intercom sync
- ❌ **Accounting Sync** - No Zoho Books/Tally integration
- ❌ **E-commerce Platforms** - No Shopify/WooCommerce native connectors
- ❌ **Marketing Automation** - No Brevo/ActiveCampaign sync

#### Market Impact:
- Most CRMs have 200+ pre-built integrations (Zapier, native connectors)
- Your 50 integrations are solid but not complete

#### Recommendation:
```
Phase 7 - Quick Wins (1 week for most):
✅ Calendar sync (Google Calendar, Outlook) - Use existing Google API setup
✅ Zapier/Make.com webhook support - Standard webhook endpoints
✅ DocuSign e-signature - OAuth + API (easy)
✅ LinkedIn integration - Browser extension approach
✅ Brevo integration - Email marketing sync
```

**Priority:** 🟠 HIGH (integrations drive adoption)

---

#### Business Impact:
**Video missing = 30-40% lower adoption**
- Users expect video + text in 2025
- Text-only documentation yields 60% completion vs 90% with video

#### Recommendation - PRIORITY:
```
This should happen BEFORE launch (Week 13):
├─ Product demo video (3-5 min) - Shows overall value prop
├─ 6 feature walkthrough videos (4 min each)
│  ├─ Sales pipeline overview
│  ├─ Deal creation & management
│  ├─ AI lead scoring explained

│  ├─ Email sync setup

```

**Effort:** 3-4 days of filming + editing  
**Cost:** $2-3k for professional video  
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL for launch (video = conversion)

---

### **9. ADVANCED FILTERING & SAVED VIEWS (70/100)** ⚠️ PARTIAL GAP
**Expected in 2025, sometimes overlooked.**

#### What You Have:

├─ Implement bulk actions toolbar
└─ Add view customization (column picker)
```

**Priority:** 🟡 MEDIUM (improves usability significantly)

---

### **10. MOBILE OPTIMIZATION FOR FEATURE PARITY (70/100)** ⏳ PENDING MANUAL TESTING
**You have core features, but full parity needs testing.**

#### Implemented on Mobile:
- ✅ Core CRM (contacts, deals, tasks)
- ✅ Offline mode with sync
- ✅ Voice interface
- ✅ Quick capture (business card OCR)
- ✅ Communication features

#### Potential Gaps (need testing):
- ⏳ Email sync on mobile (Gmail integration in app?)
- ⏳ Deal probability prediction display
- ⏳ Revenue forecast on mobile dashboard
- ⏳ Churn risk alerts on mobile
- ⏳ Complex filtering on mobile (touch UI challenges)

#### Recommendation:
