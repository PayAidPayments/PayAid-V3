## PART 10: OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS

**OBJECTION 1: "Wetroo is ₹3k and you're ₹7.9k. Why?"**

Response: "Wetroo is WhatsApp CRM (one thing). You get full business OS:
- CRM + accounting + invoicing
- Inventory management
- Marketing automation
- HR + payroll (coming)
- Advanced analytics

Wetroo = WhatsApp organization
PayAid = Run entire business

Better comparison: vs Zoho at ₹1.2k per user/month
- 5 employees: Zoho = ₹6k
- 10 employees: Zoho = ₹12k
- We're ₹7.9k flat, unlimited users. We're cheaper at scale."

**OBJECTION 2: "I need to try before I commit (want free tier)"**

Response: "Perfect. 14-day free trial gives you:
- Full product access (everything)
- No credit card
- All features enabled
- Talk to our team (free consultation)

14 days is enough to:
- Setup (5 min)
- Import data (optional)
- Test with real work
- See the value

Most conversions happen by day 7. If not convinced by day 14, cancel. No charge."

**OBJECTION 3: "Your competitor offers [feature] free"**

Response: "Great! Tell us which feature. Often competitors:
- Include feature but it's limited
- Include it but support is awful
- Include it but it's buggy
- Charge for it later after free tier

We build everything properly or don't build it. Request feature → we add to roadmap → usually ships in 30-60 days. Often included at no charge."

**OBJECTION 4: "I'm concerned about data security"**

Response: "We take security seriously:
- Bank-level encryption (256-bit SSL)
- SOC 2 Type II compliant
- ISO 27001 certified
- Data stays in India (no US servers)
- GDPR compliant
- Regular third-party audits

Your data is safer with us than on your computer."
