## Summary: Key Changes from Original Recommendations

| Aspect | Original | Revised | Rationale |

| **Patient/Student/Client Management** | Generic CRM | **Specialized add-ons with compliance** | Regulated industries (healthcare, education, legal) need industry-specific management + compliance |
| **POS Integration** | Separate from CRM | **Unified with CRM + omnichannel** | Modern retail expects real-time customer profiles synced with checkout, not siloed systems |
| **Supplier/Procurement** | Missing for many | **Explicit for manufacturing, construction, wholesale, agriculture** | Supply chain visibility is now expected as baseline, not optional |
| **Omnichannel** | Not explicit | **Standard expectation** | Online + offline + mobile unified; relevant to retail, hospitality, beauty, automotive |
