# RISK ANALYSIS & MITIGATION

## Risk 1: Feature Complexity
**Risk:** Too many features = engineering overhead  
**Mitigation:** Modular architecture, reuse code (e.g., website builder → landing page builder)  
**Probability:** Low (with proper planning)

## Risk 2: Competition
**Risk:** Zoho/others copy features  
**Mitigation:** Speed to market (6 months vs their 18+), India-first focus, AI integration  
**Probability:** Medium (but you're 2 years ahead)

## Risk 3: Customer Adoption
**Risk:** Users don't understand all features  
**Mitigation:** Excellent onboarding, customer success team, in-app tutorials  
**Probability:** Low (features solve real problems)

## Risk 4: Infrastructure Costs
**Risk:** Analytics/video storage expensive  
**Mitigation:** Lazy loading, compression, tiered storage  
**Probability:** Low (manageable with ₹10L+ MRR)

## Risk 5: Team Capacity
**Risk:** 3-4 engineers can't build all in 24 months  
**Mitigation:** Hire contractors for specific modules, use AI-assisted development (Cursor), outsource non-critical work  
**Probability:** Medium (manageable with planning)
