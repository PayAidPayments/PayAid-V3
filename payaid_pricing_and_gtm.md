**Revenue Model | Market Positioning | Sales Playbook**

## 💰 Pricing Philosophy

Your pricing MUST achieve 3 things:
1. **Profitably undercut Zoho** (same value, lower cost)
2. **Be approachable for SMBs** (₹999 entry point, not ₹5,000)
3. **Enable high-margin bundles** (MRR growth through upsell)
