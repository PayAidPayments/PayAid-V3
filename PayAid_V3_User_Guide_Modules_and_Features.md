**How to use an industry module**

1. Ensure your plan includes the industry pack (or trial).
2. Open the module from the home grid (e.g. **Restaurant**, **Retail**).
3. Follow the in-app setup (e.g. add menu, tables, or products). Use the top menu to move between sections (e.g. Orders, Reservations, Menu).
4. Use it daily for orders, bookings, or jobs; data can feed into Finance or CRM where integrated.

**Why it helps**

- **Built for your vertical** — Terms and flows match how you work.
- **Less customization** — Start with the right structure from day one.
- **One platform** — Industry + CRM + Finance in one place.
