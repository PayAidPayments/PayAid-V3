- **Recommendation:** **Tier 2 feature** (launch without, add Month 2)

#### **2. Customer Portal / Self-Service** ❌ **0% COMPLETE**
- **Status:** Accounts module backend exists, customer-facing portal UI not built
- **What Exists:** Accounts module (B2B account management), account hierarchy, account health scoring (internal CRM view)
- **What's Missing:** Customer-facing portal UI, customer login/authentication, customer dashboard, self-service ticket creation, customer contract/invoice viewing
- **Why It Matters:** Customers can't view their deals, invoices, or tickets

- **Recommendation:** **Tier 2 feature** (build directory UI, add connectors progressively)

#### **4. Advanced Approval Workflows** ⚠️ **30% COMPLETE**
- **Status:** Contract approval foundation exists, quote approvals missing
- **What Exists:** Contract model has approval fields (`requiresApproval`, `approvalWorkflow`, `ContractApproval` model), approval chain tracking in database
- **What's Missing:** Quote approval workflows (Quote model has no approval fields), approval workflow UI builder, approval execution engine, approval notifications, approval dashboard
- **Why It Matters:** Enterprise customers need multi-step approvals for both quotes and contracts
- **Effort:** 1-2 weeks for full implementation
- **Revenue:** +₹5-10k MRR
- **Recommendation:** **Tier 2 feature** (can wait, finish testing first)

#### **5. SMS Campaign Builder** ❌ **0% COMPLETE**
- **Status:** Bulk SMS API exists (`sendBulkSMS` function), campaign builder UI missing
