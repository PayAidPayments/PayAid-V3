## THE SOLUTION: BUILD IN-HOUSE (vs Resell)

### What You're Building:
```
Merchant Dashboard
    ↓
Create Voice Agent (Template-based)
    ↓ Select: Language, Voice, Prompt, Knowledge Base
    ↓
Trigger Calls (When? Who? When retry?)
    ↓ Form submission, Webhook, Scheduled
    ↓
Voice Agent Calls Customer
    ↓ Real-time AI conversation (Gemini 2.5 Live)
    ↓ Latency: <300ms (critical for phone)
    ↓
Smart Actions (Look up payment status, log outcome)
    ↓ API integrations during call
    ↓
Analytics & ROI
    ↓ Success rate, sentiment, cost, outcomes
```

### Why Build vs Resell:
| Aspect | Build | Resell |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Margin | 35-45% | 20% |
| Differentiation | Payment data | None |
| Team Value | Build AI/ML team | None |
| Control | Full | Limited |
| Timeline | 6 weeks | 2 weeks |
| Investment | ₹50-65L | ₹0 |

## PHASE ROADMAP

| Phase | Duration | Goal | Merchants | Revenue | Team |
|-------|----------|------|-----------|---------|------|
| **Phase 1 MVP** | 6 weeks | Prove concept | 50 | ₹0-30K | 5 |
| **Phase 2 Scale** | 8 weeks | Production ready | 450 | ₹1.26Cr | 12 |
| **Phase 3 Leader** | 10 weeks | Market domination | 2,500 | ₹8Cr | 20 |

**Each phase is independent.** Can stop after Phase 1 if needed (proof of concept).

---

## COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

**vs Bolna (Market Leader):**
- ✓ Payment data integration (they don't have)
- ✓ Direct 50K+ merchant distribution (they acquire 1-by-1)
- ✓ Fintech trust + TRAI expertise (our DNA)
- ✗ They have 500+ merchants already (we start at 0)

**vs Global Players (Kyzo, Omnidim):**
- ✓ India-first (they're global)
- ✓ TRAI compliance built-in (they don't understand)
- ✓ ₹5-8/min pricing (they charge $0.15-0.25/min = 3-5x more)
- ✗ They have brand + funding (they're bigger)

**Defensible Moat:** Payment data integration + TRAI expertise hard to copy.
