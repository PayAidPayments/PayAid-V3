## THE THREE PIVOTAL DECISIONS

### Decision 1: Technical Architecture ✅
**Question:** Monolith or Microservices?  
**Answer:** Monolith (Next.js + PostgreSQL) for 18 months  
**Why:** 
- 80% faster development
- Easier for small team
- Scale when you hit 100K users
- Can migrate to microservices later

### Decision 2: Go-to-Market ✅
**Question:** Sales-led or Product-led growth?  
**Answer:** Product-led growth (organic)  
**Why:**
- 50% cheaper than sales team (₹100L vs ₹200L/year)

- Faster feedback loop (product improves faster)
- Higher NPS (users adopt what they want)

**GTM Strategy:**
- Month 1-3: SEO + content (organic discovery)

- Month 10-12: Sales team (enterprise deals)

### Decision 3: Feature Prioritization ✅
**Question:** What to build first?  
**Answer:** See priority matrix in missing-features document

## WHAT COULD GO WRONG (& How to Fix It)

### Risk 1: Churn Rate Too High (>3%/month)
**Symptom:** Users stop paying after 2-3 months  
**Root Cause:** Onboarding not working, or product doesn't solve their problem  
**Fix:** Weekly customer interviews, rapid product iterations

### Risk 2: Customer Acquisition Cost Too High (>₹2,000)
**Symptom:** Spending more to acquire than you make back  
**Root Cause:** Wrong marketing channel or target  
**Fix:** Focus on organic (SEO, partnerships), not paid ads

### Risk 3: Competitor Response
**Symptom:** Zoho/Freshworks launches cheaper version  
**Root Cause:** Market is attractive, competitors notice  
**Fix:** Move fast, build moat (data, network effects), customer lock-in

### Risk 4: Technical Scaling Failure
**Symptom:** Platform crashes at 100K users  
**Root Cause:** Architecture not planned for scale  
**Fix:** This is already solved (see 3 critical fixes document)

### Risk 5: Team Burnout
**Symptom:** Founder burns out, team leaves  
**Root Cause:** Unsustainable pace  
**Fix:** Hire fast, delegate, rest is important
