## YOUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

```
PAYAID MOAT = 3 Things Together:

1. INDUSTRY-ADAPTIVE (no competitor has this)
   └─ Wetroo has WhatsApp only
   └─ Zoho has generic features
   └─ Keap has "HubSpot clone" mentality

2. AI CO-FOUNDER (integrated, not bolt-on)
   └─ Others sell "AI features"
   └─ You sell "AI that learns your business"

3. INDIA-FIRST PRICING (₹7.9k vs ₹16.5k)
   └─ Keap: Too expensive for India
   └─ You: Affordable + professional

TOGETHER = Defensible moat. Hard to copy all 3.
