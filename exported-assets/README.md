## 📝 KEY DECISIONS (MUST APPROVE)

### ✅ Decision 1: Positioning
**"Your AI learns your industry"**
- Why? Forward-looking, customer-centric, defensible
- Not: "HubSpot alternative" (reactive) or "All-in-one" (generic)

### ✅ Decision 2: Website
**Unified homepage + dynamic industry selector**
- Why? Single strong brand + SEO authority + 15-25% conversion
- Not: 6 fragmented pages (weak SEO + low conversion)

### ✅ Decision 3: Pricing
**₹7,999 / ₹15,999 / Custom + industry variance**
- Why? Flat-rate clarity + industry perception + affordability
- Not: Per-user (confusing) or too expensive (₹16.5k+)

## 🔄 UPDATES & ITERATIONS

These documents are VERSION 1.0 (locked for execution).

**If you need changes BEFORE launch (Day 24):**
- Update in Google Doc (shared with team)
- Email team of changes
- Proceed with updated version

**If changes are needed AFTER launch:**
- Document in "Month 2 Learnings" doc

---

## ❓ FAQ (META)

**Q: Can I skip START_HERE.md and jump to details?**  
A: No. START_HERE ensures leadership alignment. Skipping causes delays later.

**Q: Should I share these with the team or leadership only?**  
A: Share broadly (even individual contributors benefit from context). QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md is especially good for whole team.

**Q: What if our tech lead says we need 60 days instead of 30?**  
A: Possible. Split into MVP (15 days) + full feature (30 days). Launch MVP early.

**Q: What if competitors copy our positioning?**  
A: They can copy words, not execution. Your AI + industry workflows + pricing take 6+ months to replicate.

**Q: Can we launch with partial features?**  
A: Yes. MVP = Homepage + Free Trial + Payment + CRM module (days 20-30). Add modules post-launch.

**Q: What's the risk if we execute this perfectly?**  
A: Main risk = market education (convincing SMBs "industry OS" exists). Mitigation = content + community + partnerships.
